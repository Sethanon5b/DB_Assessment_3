# RockFlipper

Rock Flipper is an interactive 2.5D space shooter game, developed for Android and PC by Diploma of Digital and Interactive Games students from South Metropolitan TAFE. The game has been developed using the Unity game engine.

The core player experience focuses around the need to earn money. The player collects money by undertaking fly-throughs of zones in space which contain mineral resources. The player collects these resources by shooting asteroids, which, when explode, drop the resources as collectables. At the end of each level, the player automatically sells these resources to the space mining company, Frontiers Inc., earning them money and reputation.

As the player progresses through reputation levels with the space mining company, they are given access to more rewarding but perilous zones, as well as being given an opportunity to purchase better equipment to outfit their ship with.

Throughout the gameplay experience, players' total revenue is collected and uploaded to a webhost leaderboard, which pits them and their money earning abilities against other contractors of Frontiers Inc.
